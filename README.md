# odin-recipes
This is actually the first project of mine in The Odin Project and on my road to become the almighty full-stack web developer I wish so much to become.
I'm actually only wrriting this because I anyway could use some practice on my keyboard typing speed. 
Anyway, at first, this recipe site will only be coded using html and I plan on coming back on it to make it look nicer using CSS.
Good luck to me on my journey
